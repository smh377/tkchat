	Added visibility option for away/online/dnd 'availability' messages.
	Added user idle detection in win2k+ to do auto-away/xa, configurable in

	settings. It's the windowmanager's job to place new windows.

2004-12-08  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* tkchat.tcl (::tkchat::parseStr): Simplified the URL parsing
	regexp and added support for ftp URLs. It is much more relaxed in
	what it accepts as an URL now, and only tries hard to get the end
	right.

2004-12-08  Pascal Scheffers  <pascal@scheffers.net>

	* tkchat.tcl: /nick now asks any other egos you may have for a
	nick transfer.

	changes all over the place.

2004-10-13  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tkchat.tcl: Modified the startup to avoid multiple http requests
	if we get an authentication error during the logon. This avoids
	locking your account on a proxy server from too many failed login
	attempts (Windows networks). We now only do one request if it fails.
	Also changed the history loading to ensure we always load above
	any current chat text.
	Added a scrollbar to the smilies display dialog.

	* tkchat.tcl: Add user set-able value to fade too.
	(::tkchat::addMessage): Fixed dumb bug that meant messages from
	ircbridge with <xyz> would yield xyz as the sender.

2004-09-18  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tkchat.tcl: Added another gimmick. You can select a fade
	checkbox on the options dialog and when tkchat looses focus it
	will fade to 50% transparency. On recieving focus again it'll
	switch back to opaque.

	* tkchat.tcl (::tkchat::Retrieve): Bug #1030051. Be more careful
	not to overwrite the current script if we fail to get something
	sensible from the web request.

	* tkchat.tcl (::tkchat::EditOptions): Added support for toplevel
	alpha transparency (supported in the most recent Tk on Win2k/XP).

	* tkchat.tcl (::tkchat::debug, ::tkchat::SetFont,
	::tkchat::ChangeFont): Changed the code to not trample on the

	uses.

	column width too wide if SomeoneHasAReallyLongNickLikeSomeIrcUsers.

2004-08-13  Pascal Scheffers  <pascal@scheffers.net>

	* tkchat.tcl: Added a [catch] to checkPage to prevent it from

2004-06-30  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	is now more Mozilla-like.

2004-06-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tkchat.tcl (::tkchat::parseStr): add recognition of any 6 or
	7-digit sequence as a SF bug id, make it a URL that jumps to it.

	the About dialog. (by Joe Mistachkin).

	* tkchat.tcl: Removed a number of 8.4+isms so that tkchat operates
	with Tk8.3 again. Avoid eq and ne and use tk_windowingsystem.

	* tkchat.tcl: Added message timestamps and a visibility for them
	option in the Visibility menu for them.

	* tkchat.tcl: Provide activity indicators by editing the title
	when the window isn't focused and with winico support for windows.

2004-02-09  Pascal Scheffers  <pascal@scheffers.net>
	* tkchat.tcl: Updated the way messages from ircbridge and ijchain
	are handled. The new code path rewrites the messages before the
	messages are is set to 'normal' so you can just call addAction and
	return.

2004-03-16  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tkchat.tcl: Add ijbridge as a synonym for ijchain to trap
	messages from the Jabber - IRC bridge and tidy them up.

	* tkchat.tcl: Don't list the IRC users in the menubutton list. If
	we ever fix it such that we can /msg to IRC then this can be
	enabled but at the moment it's just noise.

2004-03-15  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tkchat.tcl: Removed the now redundant code using a NETSCAPE
	environment variable. We have a dialog to set this now.

2003-05-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tkchat.tcl: simplify find stuff, add support for
	"/bug ?group? ?tracker? id" requests that print correct URL.  We
